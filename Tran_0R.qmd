## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

To run the code prior to rendering, simply click the play button on the above code chunk. The output will display beneath it.

## Packages

`R` has the ability to install and load `packages` which are groups of functions created by other people for specific uses. This is one of the biggest draws of `R`, as specific fields can build packages to meet their needs.

Do the following:

1.  Remove the `#` from the start of each line of code.

2.  Press the play button.

3.  Replace the `#` at the start of each line.

```{r}
#install.packages("rmarkdown")
#install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages("survival")
#install.packages("car")
#install.packages("coin")
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
#install.packages("finalfit")
```

Once a package is installed, it is permanently on your computer and you do not need to install it again. To run more efficiently, `R` only starts in "base" mode, meaning only packages that came with the initial install are loaded when you start `R` each time. If you want to use a specific package, say `ggplot2` when coding, you'll need to "load" it in with the following code:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Notice nothing pops up when you do this, which is common for most packages. Now there are a wide number of additional functions you can use.

## Example Homework Problem

A homework problem will look like the following:

### Problem 1

Create a new vector named $x$ which contains the values 0 and 1. To do so, type into the box below:

$x <-~~c(0,1)$

Print the vector by typing just $x$ on a new line underneath.

```{r}

```

Add 5 to the vector. Type

$x + 5$

```{r}

```

Divide the vector my 0. Type

$x/0$

```{r}

```

## Submitting

Submit the following to Canvas:

-   Your rendered PDF titled Lastname_0R. Make sure your name is at the top of the document.
