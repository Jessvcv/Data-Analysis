## Problem 1

Create two data vectors $x$ and $y$ that contain the integers 1 to 21 and âˆ’10 to 10. Print both vectors.

```{r}
x <- c(1:21)
x
y <- c(-10:10)
y
```

Do the following:

\(a\) Add, subtract, multiply, and divide $x$ by $y$. Place a comment after each line of code explaining what operation you are performing in words.

```{r}
x+y #adding x & y
x-y #subtracting x & y
x*y #multiplying by x & y
x/y #dividing x by y
```

\(b\) Find the mean of each data set.

```{r}
mean(x) #mean of vector x
mean(y) #mean of vector y
```

\(c\) Find the corrected sum of squares for each data set. The formula for this is:

$$
\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

```{r}
sum((x-mean(x))^2) 
sum((y-mean(y))^2)
```

\(d\) Find the mean of the product of $x$ and $y$.

```{r}
mean(x*y)
```

## Problem 2

![](Problem_2.png)

Create a data frame called `data` with the `Problem_2.png` image on Canvas. Create your own column names as you see fit. Print `data`.

```{r}
data <- data.frame(
  "Participants" = c(1:10),
  "Level Ground" = c(56,50,41,65,47,50,64,48,47,57), 
  "Slope" = c(38,50,46,46,42,41,49,38,49,55)
)
data
```

Add a column to `data` which is the ratio of the score standing on level ground to the score standing on a slope. Print `data`.

```{r}
LevelGround <- c(56,50,41,65,47,50,64,48,47,57)
Slope <-c(38,50,46,46,42,41,49,38,49,55)
data["Ratio"] <- LevelGround/Slope
data
```

Find the mean of the score standing on level ground and the mean score standing on a slope.

```{r}
mean(data$Level.Ground)
mean(data$Slope)
```

## Problem 3

`R` has a few build in data sets, convenient for learning new skills. For example, the famous `iris` data set is built in. In the code chunk below, type in `iris` into the chunk below and run it.

```{r}
iris
```

You can treat the object `iris` just like `data` from Problem 3. Find the `min`, `max`, `median`, and `mean` of `Petal.Width`. Leave a comment after each line explaining what operation you are performing.

```{r}
min(iris$Petal.Width) #minimum of petal width
max(iris$Petal.Width) #maximum of petal width
median(iris$Petal.Width) #median of petal width
mean(iris$Petal.Width) #mean of petal width
```
